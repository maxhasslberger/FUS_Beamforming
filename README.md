# FUS_Beamforming
In this project, we simulate intracranial acoustic field patterns for future Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (FUS) treatments. At the current stage, we compare the performance of the Time Reversal method to the solution of an inverse (phase retrieval) problem in a homogeneous medium. We are directing our attention towards unconventional sonication patterns, such as multiple focal points and holographic shapes.
